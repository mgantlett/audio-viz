"Create a vibrant, futuristic demo scene inspired by 90s computer graphics, akin to FutureCrew's groundbreaking releases. The scene is a surreal, otherworldly landscape filled with complex geometric shapes, glowing neon colors, and fluid, organic motion. Floating, intricate wireframe structures twist and bend in the air, while luminous particles drift around like data streams. The scene transitions smoothly between digital realms, from a high-tech city skyline to an abstract, pixelated matrix of data, each section pulsating with energy. There's a sense of rapid, dynamic movement, with elements like glowing spheres, shifting polygons, and a blend of highly detailed textures with simple 2D art layered over. The soundtrack is fast-paced and electronic, building in intensity as the visuals intensify. The visuals play with light and shadow, with reflections and glows highlighting the digital nature of the scene, creating an almost otherworldly, hypnotic atmosphere."
