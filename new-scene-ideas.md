can cline read the samples? wavs? then it could start to make its own music??


now that we have the beat scene working well lets add a 4th scene.  have the scene just two green lazers that move together as if both here held in your hand and move with the  music

for another scene we can use the basic audio system and mouse movements from the first 2 scenes but feed it into an ociliscope for visual
