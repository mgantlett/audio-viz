now that we have the beat scene working well lets add a 4th scene.  have the scene just two green lazers that move together as if both here held in your hand and move with the  music


lets code review and check and remove any unused code.

can cline read the samples? wavs? then it could start to make its own music??

MAKE SURE AT THE END OF EVERY SUCCESSFUL TASK WE DO CODE REVIEW AND CLEANUP AND REFACTOR IF NEEDED
