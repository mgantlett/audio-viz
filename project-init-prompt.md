# Audio Visualization and Music Creation System

A modern take on the demoscene tradition, combining a music tracker interface with real-time visualizations. This project creates an immersive audio-visual experience where music and graphics are tightly integrated, featuring both pre-programmed sequences and real-time interactive elements. The app is hosted at https://mgantlett.github.io/audio-viz/
